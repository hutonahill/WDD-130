            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>

            <p>
                Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the 
                Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the 
                River of No Return by the people living near it because of the 
                number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the 
                rugged beauty of the river that they never left. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and 
                bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river 
                corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which 
                tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
                from sun or rain when needed.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
                is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As 
                a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in 
                the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.
                There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who
                like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
                water more.

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>

            <p>
                Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most 
                desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the 
                mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run 
                famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys 
                Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding 
                scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
                and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
            </p>

            <p>
                Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history 
                that the canyon tells.

            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>

            <p>
                This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all 
                river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with 
                breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river 
                experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian 
                ruins accessible only by river. 
            </p>

            <p>
                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating 
                scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X 
                ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and 
                river variances. However, most people are familiar with the 
                regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
