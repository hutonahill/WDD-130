    <p>   I grew up in the church in Milpitas CA, a small town between San Jose and Freemont.  I was homeschooled through highschool in an amazing home school comunity. 
        <br>I first came up to BYUI in the fall of 2020 studying mechanical engenearing, but id did very poorly. In an effort to improve ive swiched my major to Softwere Enginearing as I think the class format will be better for me.
